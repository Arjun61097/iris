IMPLEMENTATION:  

Perform EDA and explore the features.  
Encode the target variable.  
Split dataset into training, validation and test data.  
Implement KFold Cross Validation.  
Implement Grid Search to find optimal hyperparameters for SVC, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier.  
Analyze the results on Validation set and test set.  
Compare the performance of model using precision, recall, accuracy, latency.
